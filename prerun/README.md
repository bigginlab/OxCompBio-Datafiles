# MD Prerun Simulation

## Contents

This directory should contain:

* The data generated during the protein System Setup step (in the setup subdirectory).
* The data generated from performing the energy minimization and the MD production run (in the run subdirectory).
* The data generated after performing the analysis using the relevant built-in GROMACS tools (in the run subdirectory).

as detailed in Juputer Notebook [03_Running_an_MD_simulation.ipynb](https://github.com/bigginlab/OxCompBio/tree/master/tutorials/MD/03_Running_an_MD_simulation.ipynb).

You should use it only if for some reason you haven't managed to successfully run your own simulation or if you get stuck/confused.
